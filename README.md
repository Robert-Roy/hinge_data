# Hinge Data Explorer

[Check out the site here](https://hinge.etopiei.com)

So I recently tried out the app Hinge and one of the best things about it is that you can export your data (yay for European data laws). Going through the data manually though is a bit of a pain, so I wrote some scripts to check stuff out. After talking to some friends about it I got some feedback and started adding more features and info and now it's been built into the tool you see today. 

Have fun exploring!
